# Eternal Elude
A simple rogue-like with a generative map that I have created for my A-Level Computer Science project. You play as a swordsmen who explores the dungeon, while killing goblins across the way. You are able to upgrade stats to your liking which is essential for further exploration - the further you explore, the tougher the goblins.

## Instructions

The rest will be explained within the game.

Have fun!
